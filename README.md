# Coursera IBM AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning  
Completed by Gokul Seetharaman on 9th May, 2025.

This repository contains the notebooks and scripts used to complete the final Capstone project of the Coursera course **AI Capstone: Deep Learning** by **IBM**.

This marks the completion of 3 PyTorch-based courses from the **IBM AI Engineering** series on Coursera:
- Introduction to Neural Networks and PyTorch  
- Deep Learning with PyTorch  
- AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning

Through these courses, I gained hands-on experience in:
• Building and training neural networks with PyTorch  
• Implementing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
• Applying transfer learning techniques for image classification  
• Saving, loading, and testing deep learning models

**Topics covered:** Neural Networks, Deep Learning, CNNs, Transfer Learning, Image Classification  
**Libraries used:** PyTorch, torchvision, Pillow, NumPy  
**Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab

This project demonstrates practical applications of deep learning techniques using **PyTorch** for real-world problems.
